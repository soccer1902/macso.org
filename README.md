# macso.org

Public website for the Massachusetts Computer Science Olympiad, built with
React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.com/) 1.3.14

The required Bun version is pinned in `package.json`. Keep it aligned with the
version used by CI and the deployment platform.

## Setup

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run dev
```

Vite prints the local development URL after startup.

## Commands

| Command                | Purpose                                       |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `bun run dev`          | Start the development server                  |
| `bun run format`       | Format tracked source and configuration files |
| `bun run format:check` | Check formatting without changing files       |
| `bun run lint`         | Run Oxlint and reject warnings                |
| `bun run typecheck`    | Type-check the project                        |
| `bun run build`        | Type-check and create the production build    |
| `bun run check`        | Run every local quality check used before CI  |
| `bun run size:check`   | Enforce checked-in JavaScript and CSS budgets |
| `bun run lighthouse`   | Run Lighthouse against the production build   |
| `bun run preview`      | Preview the production build locally          |

Run `bun run check` before opening a pull request.

## Environment variables

The site currently requires no environment variables. If configuration is
added later, document it in `.env.example` and keep real `.env` files local.

Values prefixed with `VITE_` are embedded in the browser bundle and must never
contain secrets.

## Performance gates

CI rejects JavaScript or CSS growth beyond the limits in
`scripts/check-build-size.mjs`. The initial limits leave roughly 10–15% above
the current production build and should be raised only with an explanation in
the pull request.

Lighthouse runs three times against both generated pages. Accessibility, SEO,
layout stability, blocking time, and best-practice regressions fail CI;
performance-score and largest-contentful-paint regressions initially warn while
the project establishes a stable baseline.
