        MACSO 2026 is a single in-person contest: 6 coding problems, a 2-hour
        contest, competed individually. There's no online qualification stage
        this year, just register and show up!

  {
    question: 'What is the scoring system like?',
    answer: (
      <>
        The contest uses the ICPC system: each problem is either solved or not,
        and the time penalty serves as tie breaker.
